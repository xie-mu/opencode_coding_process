# Soul format

## On disk

A soul is a single file:

- `SOUL.md` (or `soul.md`)

For now, onlycrabs.ai rejects any extra files.

## `SOUL.md`

- Markdown with optional YAML frontmatter.
- The server extracts metadata from frontmatter during publish.
- `description` is used as the soul summary in the UI/search.

## Limits

- Total bundle size: 50MB.
- Embedding text includes `SOUL.md` only.

## Slugs

- Derived from folder name by default.
- Must be lowercase and URL-safe: `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$`.

## Versioning + tags

- Each publish creates a new version (semver).
- Tags are string pointers to a version; `latest` is commonly used.
